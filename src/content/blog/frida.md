  ### She's cute and she knows it


  Here is a non-exhaustive list of reasons why Frida makes being at home cozy:


  * she wants to be where you are

  * she finds the perfect spot on top of you to gift you some warmth in winter while reading a book and drinking a tea

  * she follows you through the house and gets in between to legs, making you almost trip

  * she likes rubbing her faces against yours

  * she has a distinctive **meaow*** that is rather quiet and that gives the impression that she is trying to talk to you and might soon start reciting the events of the Battle of Waterloo in perfect British accent




  In the photo you can see her helping us prepare our luggage for a trip into foreign lands.




  > *"Her black hair and the indifferent look she never seems to put down made us name her after the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo"*




  *\* I have come to believe that every cat has a distinctive meaow. Before fostering several different cats I had no idea how diverse the voices of cats can be*
